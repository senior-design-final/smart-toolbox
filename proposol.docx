Recommender systems predict the likeliness of users based on their previous preferences. Recomendations will be based upon 
the rating that the users have provided in their previous choices. Colaborative filtering helps users find their
openings and predict what they will like next and recommend them based on thier likeliness.
Data mining tasks that are performed in this project will be to display business based on the user's preferences. Another 
aspect of this project is to recommend users to other businesses based on their preferences. 

At the end of the semester, a site will be running either on my server or github server which will display recommended business based 
on the choices users have made. 
 
There are some challenges to accomplish this websites. First one is the time constraint. I think the time will be some 
hurdle to complete the project because at this time I would not know whether  I will get stuck on certain part 
of the implementation or not. The second one is to understand the contents of data mining. I need to understand on h
ow the collaborating filtering works. Knowing the details of collaborating filtering also takes some time.
